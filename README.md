This project is a lightweight personal “About Me” page built with HTML and CSS. It presents a simple layout that displays a photo, a brief introduction, and a downloadable CV. The design is clean and minimal, making it ideal for beginners or anyone who wants a basic personal profile page.
It can also serve as a small section in a portfolio or be hosted on GitHub Pages.
